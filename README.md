## HTTP Request Tester

This tool serves the feature of sending HTTP requests on a specific server / website. The backend and functionalities of this tool are mainly written in Javascript.

## Usage

The tool doesn't required any installable dependencies, or else. Just make sure the browser you are using to test the tool has CORS allowed. Otherwise, there would be much errors faced due to the testing of the HTTP requests. The tool is just a HTML file and a linked javascript file (vanilla js). Just make sure both the files are in the same folder during the testing period.
